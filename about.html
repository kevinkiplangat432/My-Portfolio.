    <h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Kevin and currently am a student at <b>Moringa School</b> studying <I>Software Engineering.</I> </p>
    <p>I am really passionate about Tech in general. But as of recent I’ve grown passionate about front-end development—turning ideas into clean, interactive, and responsive designs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy challenging myself with projects that push me to learn more, whether it’s designing smooth navigation, experimenting with animations, or structuring a real website. Beyond just coding, I’m motivated by the idea of building digital experiences that feel intuitive and enjoyable to use, and I’m excited to keep expanding my skills in React and other modern technologies. </p>
    <p>Outside of coding, I’m a big fan of music and movies. I love discovering new artists and genres, and I often find inspiration for my projects from the creativity in music videos and film. I also enjoy reading tech blogs and watching tutorials to stay updated on the latest trends and best practices in web development. When I’m not immersed in the digital world, I like to spend time outdoors, whether it’s going for a walk or just relaxing in nature. This balance helps me recharge and come back to my coding projects with fresh ideas and renewed energy.</p>
    <h2 class="title">My Story</h2>
    <p>I didn’t stumble into tech by accident—it started with curiosity. I was always fascinated by how websites and apps seemed to “just work.” At first, I used to wonder what kind of magic was behind them, until I discovered coding was the language that powered everything. Once I wrote my first line of HTML and saw something show up on a browser, I was hooked. That tiny spark grew into hours of exploring CSS, breaking things, fixing them, and feeling that rush every time I solved a problem. Eventually, I started learning JavaScript, which unlocked a whole new world where websites weren’t just static pages, but interactive experiences. What excites me most now is not just learning to code, but the idea that I can build something that others can actually use. For me, tech is a mix of creativity and logic, and that’s what keeps me going.</p>
